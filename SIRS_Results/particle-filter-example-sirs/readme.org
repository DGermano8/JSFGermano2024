* Model

** Stoichiometric

Here are the reactant and products as needed by the hybrid model and
the flows as needed by the CTMC model.

** Differential equations

Here are the differential equations used by the ODE model:

$\frac{dS}{dt} = -\frac{\beta SI}{N} - \mu S + \kappa (S + I + R) + \omega R$

$\frac{dI}{dt} = +\frac{\beta SI}{N} - \gamma I - \mu I $

$\frac{dI}{dt} = +\gamma I - \mu R - \omega R $


* Simulations
The exact settings to describe the simulation are set in the file [[file:./sirs-simulation.toml]]. 
Here, you set: 
- the initial conditions,
- the parameters,
- the sampler (ODE, or JSF)

To run the simulations, use the following command:
#+begin_src sh
  python3 run-simulations.py
#+end_src

* Inference
To run the inference on some data, you first describe the data in a file, e.g., [[file:./sirs-data.ssv]]. 
Then, you set the inference settings in the file [[file:./sirs-inference.toml]].

To run the inference, use the following command:
#+begin_src sh
  python3 run-inference.py
#+end_src

* Plotting/Analysis
To plot the results, please use the code found in the folder [[file:../matlab-sirs]].

* Environment

The [[file:./requirements.txt][requirements.txt]] file contains a description of the packages (and
versions) needed to run this.

** Setting up the environment

Use the following to set up a virtual environment.

#+begin_src sh
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install -U pip
  pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src
